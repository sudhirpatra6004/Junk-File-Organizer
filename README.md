# Junk-File-Organizer

Basically, as a slacker coder, my desktop is clogged with files (Junk Files). It is a difficult task to sit and organise each file due to the high amount of files. To make this work easier, use the Python script below, which organises all of the files in a neat and orderly manner in seconds.

Main functionality of this project
