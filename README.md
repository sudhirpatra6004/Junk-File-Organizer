# Junk-File-Organizer

Basically, as a slacker coder, my desktop is clogged with files (Junk Files). It is a difficult task to sit and organise each file due to the high amount of files. To make this work easier, use the Python script below, which organises all of the files in a neat and orderly manner in seconds.

Main functionality of this project

Organize by extension
Organize by size
Organize by last used date
Reset


We can use this python script directly through command prompt by using the command:- 
"python junk_project.py --path C:\Users\Sudhir\Downloads --o extension"  For Organize with extension
"python junk_project.py --path C:\Users\Sudhir\Downloads --o size" For organize with size
"python junk_project.py --path C:\Users\Sudhir\Downloads --o use" For organize with last used date
"python junk_project.py --path C:\Users\Sudhir\Downloads --o reset" For reset files
